  <h1>My name is Gwen Bock</h1>
 
        <p>I play a lot of video games in my free time, I'm especially a fan of 
Sonic the Hedgehog. I also love playing music, I play a few instruments but mostly
guitar. I also really love working with computers and it's something I want to make 
a career out of.</p>
