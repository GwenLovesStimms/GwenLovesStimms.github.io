# About Me
## Some of my interests
* **Video Games**  
  I've been playing and collecting video games ever since I was a child. I have a large video game and console collection that spans every generation. Some of my favorite games are Final Fantasy VII, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Super Mario World.
* **Playing Music**  
 I have also been playing music since I was a kid. I started off in choir and orchestra but now I primarily play guitar, bass, and drums.
* **Computers**  
 I just think computers are neat. Little information machines that can solve problems and run programs. I've been interested in computers since my mom and dad introduced me to Windows XP around 2006 or 2007.

## Websites I like
* [**Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/)  
 Steam is the primary website I use to play games on my computer. I use it primarily because of the community support, consumer friendly practices of its owner Valve, and its constant sales. _There are a lot of sales_.
* [**Ultimate Guitar**](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/)  
 Ultimate Guitar is the website I use to learn almost all my songs on guitar and bass. Once again, it has really good community support. And all of the tablature (_musical notation for guitar_) is well done and easy to learn.
* [**User Benchmark**](https://www.userbenchmark.com/)  
 User Benchmark is the website that I use to compare the prices and performance of computer parts. It has a software tool that I use to check the performance of my PC. It's useful if you're looking to shop for a new CPU or Graphics Card.
